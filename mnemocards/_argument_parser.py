DANGER!!!
Use at your own risk.
This command deletes notes and cards, make sure you have a backup of your collection.

After importing packages, removes all the cards from the decks that have not been imported.
This is useful when you delete a card from your text files that you use for generating the apkg.
By default, if the apkg file does not contain that card but the collection does, that card is not going to be deleted from the collection.

How does this works?
When you import a package, even if the cards have not been modified, a timestamp is updated for those cards present in the package.
If there is any card with a lower timestamp it means that that it was not imported with the last imported apkg.
So this command deletes all those cards that are in the collection but were not imported.
