## Generate beautiful anki cards automatically <br/> based on your notes in Google Play Books

This is a project based on original generator for beautiful anki-cards [Mnemocards](https://github.com/guiferviz/mnemocards) by [guiferviz](https://github.com/guiferviz)

For now it will have all the functionality of `mnemocards`, including my own
addition - automatic generation of vocabulary cards from list of words using
Google Translate (pending review in original repo, will be a part of a main
program.)

During the work I will transform the program: truncate some obsolete functions 
and make it in single-purpose - to download book-notes made in Google Play Books
app and generate vocabulary cards for selected words and information cards for
excerpts.

[Original README](README_original.md) contains info on how to use program as of
state of the start of development.
